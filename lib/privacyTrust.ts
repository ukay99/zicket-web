 * (paying, connecting a wallet). It tells the user, in plain language, exactly
 * what data IS shared and what is NOT shared, adapting the wording to the
 * context and the event's privacy level. This file holds the copy only — no JSX
 * and no dependencies — so the words live in one place and stay easy to review.
 *
 * The `icon` on each item is a stable key (not a component) so this module stays
 * framework-free; the modal maps each key to a real icon.
